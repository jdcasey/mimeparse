This module provides basic functions for parsing mime-type names and matching them against a list of media-ranges.

See section 14.1 of RFC 2616 (the HTTP specification) for a complete explanation.

Testing
=======
The Python tests require either Python 2.6 or the installation of the SimpleJSON library.

Installing SimpleJson can be done by:
sudo easy_install simplejson

Run the tests by typing:
python mimeparse_test.py
